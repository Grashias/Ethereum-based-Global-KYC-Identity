# Ethereum-based-Global-KYC-Identity
This MVP/POC is based on Global Identity management or even implemented for Global KYC. 

I have used the Public/open blockchain (ETHEREUM) to achieve it, as Public blockchain is open to all it can be used globally with no restrictions, also the personal data will be encrypted so as  to secure the information.

***************************************************************************************************************************************

1. Global KYC / Identity is nothing but a unique ID for each person who is residing in any of the geolocation over the Globe.

2. This is fully client based product as all the credentials will be stored at the Client-end.

3. All interactions to the server via NodeJS API's and web3 modules in NodeJS to interact with the Ethereum network.

4. Moreover Database is not used and everything is stored in the Ethereum Smart Contract itself.

5. This product has two main modules User and Validator.

6. User is the one who is willing to create a Global Identity in the ecosystem.

7. User will be assigned with the Ethereum account address through which he can submit his details and other required details.

8. I have assumed the Global Identity (eg : GKYC-GR-800523) will be of prefix GKYC and middle word with 2 characters of the user and 3rd with random 6 digit number or can use UUID as well.

9. Validators may be any Government bodies who validates the registered user.

10. Validators fetches the portal user details, verifies the user through digital signatures with respect to their wallet address and then finally approves that user.
